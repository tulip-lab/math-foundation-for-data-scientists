# Stochastic Processes 

The Bernoulli Process and the Poisson Process are two fundamental stochastic processes in probability theory, each modeling different types of random events.

A Bernoulli Process is a sequence of independent and identically distributed random experiments, each of which results in a success or a failure (often denoted as 1 and 0, respectively). The probability of success remains constant in each trial. This process is used to model scenarios that have a binary outcome, such as flipping a coin or a system receiving a signal. It serves as the basis for understanding more complex processes and is a cornerstone in the study of discrete-time stochastic processes.

The Poisson Process, on the other hand, is a continuous-time stochastic process that models the occurrence of random events over time, under the assumption that these events occur independently and at a constant average rate. It is particularly useful for modeling the number of events happening in a fixed period of time or space, such as the number of phone calls received by a call center, or the decay of radioactive particles. The Poisson Process is characterized by its simplicity and the ability to handle a wide range of real-world phenomena, making it a critical tool in fields ranging from telecommunications to natural sciences. Both the Bernoulli and Poisson processes provide fundamental insights into the nature of random events and are essential in the study and application of probability and statistics.
