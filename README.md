## :bulb: Content

Designed primarily for aspiring data scientists, this *course* (aka *unit*) lays the foundational groundwork in key areas such as linear algebra, matrix operations, probability theory, and statistical inference, culminating with an introduction to convex optimization.

The course begins with basic Linear Algebra, providing insights into vectors, matrices, and their operations, pivotal for understanding common data representation in data science. It progresses to Matrix Factorization, where students explore matrix decomposition techniques like QR and LU Factorization, crucial for dimensionality reduction and data interpretation. A significant focus is given to *Singular Value Decomposition* (SVD), a cornerstone technique for data compression and reduction, often employed in *Principal Component Analysis* (PCA). 

In Probability Theory, the course covers fundamental concepts including random variables, distributions, and Bayes Theorem, essential for modeling uncertainty in data science. The Statistical Inference module delves into estimation, hypothesis testing, and regression analysis, empowering students to make informed conclusions from data. 

Finally, the course introduces Convex Optimization, a critical area in machine learning, focusing on optimization problems, gradient descent methods, and their applications in algorithmic development.

This course is a blend of theory and practical application, aimed at providing a comprehensive mathematical toolkit for future data scientists.

## :ledger: Sessions

Students will have access to a comprehensive range of subject materials, comprising slides handouts, and relevant readings. It is recommended that students commence their engagement with each session by thoroughly reviewing the pertinent slides handouts and readings to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the content.

Additionally, students are encouraged to supplement their knowledge by conducting independent research, utilizing online resources or referring to textbooks that cover relevant information related to the topics under study.

### :u6e80: Assessment

Every cohort might be assessed differently, depending on the specific requirements of your universities.

The assessment of the unit is mainly aimed at assessing the students' achievement of the unit learning outcomes (`ULOs`, a.k.a. objectives), and checking the students' mastery of those theory and methods covered in the unit. 

#### :book: Assessment Plan

The detailed assessment specification and marking rubrics can be found at:
[S00D-Assessment](S00-Induction/S00D-Assessment.md). The relationship between each assessment task and the ULOs are shown as follows:

| :microscope: <br> Task  |   :man_teacher: <br> Category |  :dart: <br> [ULO1](S00-Induction/S00C-Logistics.md#ULO1)  | :dart: <br> [ULO2](S00-Induction/S00C-Logistics.md#ULO2) |  :dart: <br> [ULO3](S00-Induction/S00C-Logistics.md#ULO3)  |  Percentage | 
| :----: |  :---: | ------|-------| ----- |  ----- |  
| :one: | Presentation | 50%| 25%  |   25%  | **100%** |   


#### :spiral_calendar: Submission Due Dates

- **2024** - The final assessment files submissions due date is :spiral_calendar: `Saturday, 18/05/2024` (tentative), group of **one** member only (**individual** work) for all tasks.

It is expected that you will submit the assessment component on time. You will not be allowed to start everything at the last moment, because we will provide you with feedback that you will be expected to use in future assessments.
