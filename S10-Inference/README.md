# Statistical Inference

Frequentist and Bayesian statistics represent two fundamental approaches to statistical inference, each with its distinct methodology and interpretation of probability.

Frequentist statistics, the more traditional approach, interprets probability as the long-run frequency of events occurring in repeated trials. It relies on the concept of likelihood and employs methods such as Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) to infer parameters. MLE finds the parameter values that maximize the likelihood of observing the given data. This approach is widely used for its simplicity and solid theoretical foundation, particularly in hypothesis testing, where data are analyzed to accept or reject a null hypothesis based on a pre-defined significance level.

Bayesian statistics, in contrast, treats probability as a measure of belief or certainty about a parameter. This approach updates the probability as more evidence or data becomes available, using Bayes' theorem. Bayesian inference involves computing the Posterior probability, often through Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation, which maximizes the posterior probability of the parameters given the data. MAP includes prior knowledge or beliefs about the parameters and is a hallmark of the Bayesian approach.

Hypothesis testing in frequentist statistics is closely linked with the concept of the p-value, which measures the probability of observing data at least as extreme as the sample, under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. A low p-value indicates that the observed data is unlikely under the null hypothesis, leading to its rejection. These methodologies, MLE in frequentist and MAP in Bayesian inference, represent contrasting but powerful tools for statistical analysis, each providing unique insights and applications in the realm of data interpretation and decision-making.
