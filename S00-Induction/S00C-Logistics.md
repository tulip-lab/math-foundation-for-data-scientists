## :male_detective: Teaching Method

`Math Foundations for Data Scientists` has shifted slightly from the traditional delivery of lectures into a multi-faceted teaching methodology that includes classroom teaching, in-depth student discussions and seminars on advanced topics.

According to the plan, this unit needs a total of **48** class hours, including **40** hours teaching, and **8** hours student presentation/discussion. The unit content is structured around the following key aspects:

- **Building a strong foundation**: The unit focuses on providing fundamental knowledge of math for data science. By gaining a thorough understanding of these fundamental concepts and principles, students will be equipped to undertake the latest development in machine learning.

- **Instilling values and cultivating a scientific mindset**: The unit aims to instil in students the spirit of a scientist. Theoretical courses embed this scientific spirit, while practical courses emphasise its application. By fostering qualities such as the pursuit of truth, kindness, humility, critical thinking, innovation and cooperation, the unit contributes to the development of students' scientific character. It encourages questioning, analytical thinking, hypothesising and testing etc.

### :newspaper_roll: Unit Materials

In this unit, all lecture slides handouts will be provided prior to the class, so that students can prepare in advance and have some question prepared for the lecture sessions.

Just because we give you a lot of the content in advance, it doesn't mean that we expect you to teach yourself. You do the **learning** - we can't do that part instead of you - but you can still leave the **teaching** to us: you will have ample opportunities to ask questions in the class: **interactive activities** will be done in the lecture classes. For those who can't make it to the live sessions or have urgent questions that can't wait for the next available class, through the discussion forums at GitHub [![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/tulip-lab/math-foundation-for-data-scientists)](https://github.com/tulip-lab/math-foundation-for-data-scientists/issues)

#### :microscope: Sessions

To facilitate the study, we have organised the contents into a structure where each session corresponding to one set of classes. In each session, you are provided with the lecture slides handouts.

Within this unit, you'll find [preliminary sessions](#preliminary-sessions), [core sessions](#core-sessions) and [advanced sessions](#advanced-sessions). We'll explain each of these, and how they relate to your unit assessment.

We would like you to go through the sessions at the time of your ease, and then work on the `assessment` tasks. The first thing you'll notice when you begin working through the sessions is that each has a consistent format, especially featuring:

- A `session` `README.md` page: here you'll find the overview for the session, and most download materials are available through this page. It is especially important that you make note of these as they explain the sessions structure and the supplementary resources for the session. In order to successfully complete each session, you will need to ensure that you have achieved each of these objectives.



#### :dolphin: Preliminary Sessions

We will provide some overview introduction to the unit, as well as the path to excellence. 

#### :koala: Core Sessions

At the heart of the unit are **10** core sessions. These core sessions address the statistical machine learning theory that are relevant and important for researchers. Therefore, it is an essential requirement of this unit that all core sessions are completed.

#### :eagle: Advanced Sessions

In additional to [core sessions](#core-sessions), there are some advanced topics. These topics are **optional**, and they either build on the information in the [core sessions](#core-sessions) by exploring concepts in greater depth, or introduce new, more specialised topics.

They are there for those wishing to expand their knowledge or explore specific topics in further detail. Depending on your course, you may like to choose those advanced topics which are most relevant.

## :dart: Unit Learning Outcomes 

We aim to generate enthusiasm for theoretical machine learning and improve teaching effectiveness through lecturer experience sharing, session-based discussion and real-world project-based assessment.

### **ULO1** 

**Mastery of Core Mathematical Concepts**: Students will gain a comprehensive understanding of fundamental mathematical principles critical to data science, including linear algebra, matrix factorization, probability theory, and statistical inference. This includes the ability to perform vector and matrix operations, understand eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and apply concepts of probability and statistics to real-world data science problems.


### **ULO2** 

**Development of Analytical and Problem-Solving Skills**: Through rigorous coursework and hands-on exercises, students will enhance their analytical and problem-solving abilities. They will learn to critically analyze data, develop hypotheses, and use mathematical tools to validate or refute these hypotheses, preparing them for complex problem-solving in professional data science roles.

### **ULO3** 

**Application of Theoretical Knowledge to Practical Problems**: Students will develop the skills to apply mathematical theories to practical data science challenges. This includes using singular value decomposition (SVD) for data reduction, implementing statistical methods for data analysis and inference, and employing basic concepts of convex optimization in machine learning algorithms.
